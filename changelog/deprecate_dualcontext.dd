Deprecate local templates that receive local symbols by alias

Support for instantiating local and member templates with local
symbols was implemented in DMD 2.087.0. However, the implementation
was incompatible with GDC and LDC backends.

In order to maintain feature parity among D implementations, this
improvement has been deprecated, and may be removed from a future DMD
release.
