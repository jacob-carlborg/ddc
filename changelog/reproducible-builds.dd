Environment variable `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is now supported

The environment variable `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is used for
$(LINK2 https://reproducible-builds.org/, reproducible builds).
It is an UNIX timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00),
as described $(LINK2 https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/, here).
DMD now correctly recognize it and will set the `__DATE__`,
`__TIME__`, and `__TIMESTAMP__` tokens accordingly.
