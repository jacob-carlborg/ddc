DDoc Markdown support has been enabled by default

Ddoc's [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) has now been enabled by default.
The full list of supported Markdown features (headings, emphasized text, links, and more) is described in [the Ddoc documentation page](https://dlang.org/spec/ddoc.html#highlighting).

For the more cautious, a list of all instances of Markdown features can be logged with `-transition=vmarkdown`.
If you encounter issues with this transition, you can temporarily disable the processing of the Markdown features with `-revert=markdown` and report an issue.

A huge thanks goes to David Gileadi for championing this issue!
