The allMembers trait behaves more correctly with imports

1. `import`s are represented using their fully qualified name. Previously only the first identifier of the import chain was present in the list,

---
module test;
import std.algorithm;
static assert ([__traits(allMembers, test)] == ["object", "std.algorithm"]);
---

2. members of a package, e.g `std.algorithm` or `std.range` can be retrieved, previously an empty tuple was returned

---
module test;
import std.algorithm;
static assert ([__traits(allMembers, std.algorithm)] ==[
                    "object",
                    "std.algorithm.comparison", "std.algorithm.iteration",
                    "std.algorithm.mutation", "std.algorithm.searching",
                    "std.algorithm.setops", "std.algorithm.sorting",
                    "std.functional"
                ]) ;
