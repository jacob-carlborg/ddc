Introduced `__traits(getVisibility, Sym)` as an alias to `getProtection`

Since the changes in v2.071.0, attributes such as `private`, `protected`, `public`,
etc... are visibility attributes, and not protection attributes.
However, the name of this trait predates such change and was thus inconsistent with
all the other documentation.
This change only introduce the new name, and `getProtection` has been left un-deprecated,
and while using the new name is reccommended for users that only supports the latest
version of the language, there is no plan to deprecate it.
