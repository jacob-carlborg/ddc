DMD's JSON output now have distinct types for [shared] module constructor/destructor

Previously, module constructors and destructors (shared or not) would be output as
functions, and the only way for documentation generators to recognize them was
to search for the pattern that was used for their naming.
This means that external tools would need to depend on internal compiler details
for generating documentation.
From this release, 4 new values have been introduced for `kind`:
`shared static constructor`, `shared static destructor`, `static constructor`, `static destructor`.
